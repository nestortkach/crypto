Instead, it uses Tangle - a decentralized network of nodes to confirm transactions. IOTA (or MIOTA) is the cryptocurrency this network uses to facilitate transactions and reward network participants.

            <p>
              Iota is built on a distributed ledger tech, though it operates somewhat differently to other blockchains.
              Itâ€™s network, Tangle, uses a different consensus algorithm - a Direct Acyclic Grapg (DAG). This allows the
              network to run without miners, validators, blocks or any transaction fees.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result, Iota network is highly scalable and has lower computing costs than other blockchains. This is
              important for operating IoT devices within an IoT economy - reducing the high transaction costs, improving
              energy efficiency and as such allowing for more use cases.
