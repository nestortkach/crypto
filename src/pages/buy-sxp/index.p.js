            <p>
              The Solar blockchain is fast, with transactions taking 8 seconds to process. It is extremely secure,
              sustainable, and energy efficient. SXP holders can vote for Solar block producers using the Solar Desktop
              Wallet. Voting is very simple and voters can choose to vote for one or more block producers who can then
              reward their voters with a percentage of block rewards. Unlike other DPoS projects, voting does not lock
              funds, votes can be changed at will and SXP can be added or removed from a voters wallet at any time.
