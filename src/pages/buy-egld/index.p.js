            <p>
              What makes MultiversX stand out from similar blockchains is its high transaction speed (15,000 tr/s) and
              very low fees ($0,001 per transaction). This turns it into a strong Ethereum rival by outperforming it
              while also being more energy efficient.

            <br />
            <p>
              MultiversX employs two mechanisms to achieve high efficiency:
              <p>
                Adaptive State Sharing - splitting the decentralized network into individual segments that run tasks in
                parallel in an optimized way
              </p>{' '}
              Secure Proof-of-Stake(SPoS) - an algorithm in which nodes stake their EGLD to take part in validation and
              all validators are assigned scores that influence the likelihood of them being selected. all validators
              are assigned scores that influence the likelihood of them being selected.

        text: (

            <p>
              EGLD finds utility in that it is used to maintain the MultiversX network as well as sending, operating
              smart contracts and rewarding contributors.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Users can stake EGLD on the MultiversX network, which gives them newly minted EGLD, among other benefits.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Of course, the fact that MultiversX outmatches the Ethereum blockchain in some of its aspects makes many
              investors believe in EGLDâ€™s future potential.
