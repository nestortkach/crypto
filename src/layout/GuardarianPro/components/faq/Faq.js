        Subscriptions are a tool that lets you delegate your routine crypto exchanges to us, so you can focus on what is
        really important to you. You just need to choose what, how much and how often to exchange. After this is done,
        we will start making secure crypto transactions directly into your wallet of choice while you do what matters ot
        you the most.

        doesnâ€™t have to worry about doing manual exchanges - he can simply watch his crypto portfolio grow as we safely
        do his investments for him!
