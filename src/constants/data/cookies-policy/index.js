            Cookies are used to understand how users interact with different services and thus how service providers can
            improve these ser. Unfortunately, in most cases there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies
            without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to the site. It is recommended that
            users accept the usage of cookies even if they are not sure whether they need them or not, in case they are
            necessary for a service that they use.

            Cookies are used when users are logged in, so that the service provider can remember and identify you as
            users. This prevents you from having to log in every single time you visit a new page. These cookies are
            typically removed or cleared when you log out to ensure that you can only access restricted features and
            areas when logged in.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you submit data through a form such as a contact page or comment box, cookies may be set to remember
            your user details for future correspondence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the cookies used are persistent, which means that they remain stored on your device for one year.

          <p>
            In some cases, service providers may provide you with custom content based on what you tell them about
            yourself, either directly or indirectly if you link a social media account. These types of cookies simply
            allow these service providers to provide you with content that they feel may be of interest to you.

            analytics are used to track and measure usage of website so that service providers can continue to produce
            engaging content. These cookies may track things such as how long users spend on the site or pages they
            visit, which helps them to understand how they can improve the site for you as users.

            during this period, these cookies may be used to ensure that users receive a consistent experience on the
            site.
