            The crypto market is subject to several certain rules and regulations which make it mandatory for most
            crypto services to have the AML/KYC procedure implemented.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guardarian strives to protect our clients from any type of scams and fraudulent activities in the crypto
            world one of the ways that enable us to do so is the KYC/AML procedure.
          </p>
          <p>
            This procedure confirms the absolute legality of the transaction carried out by you before the regulatory
            institutions. So you confirm that you are a law-abiding citizen and the state has no reason to address any
            claims towards you.

            To verify your identity, you will receive a code in an SMS on the mobile number you have provided, you will
            also be prompted to enter your information and upload some required documents. We will then verify your
            identity and approve your transaction, provided you have met the following requirements.
          </p>
          <p>Proof of ID</p>
          <p>
            For you to be given access to our services, we need to verify your identity by the KYC requirements of the
            company. We accept only valid international passports, a National ID card/Residence permit, and a Driving
            license as a valid means of identification.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll also ask you for a 3D Liveness Check or Selfie photograph which requires camera access on the device
            you are using.

          <p>
            Most verifications are processed automatically between a few minutes and a few hours, but if you’ve
            submitted a document or image that doesn’t meet our requirements, we might have to review it manually and
            this could cause additional delays. You would be notified if you need to submit additional verification
            documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get verified faster, please ensure you are registering with your legal name as shown on your
            identification document, also ensure you are uploading the right type of identification document which is
            still valid and clear enough to be able to read all the details contained therein.

          <p>
            You only need to be verified once and all following transactions will be automatic. However, we will require
            verification if you decide to use another bank account.
