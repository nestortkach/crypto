          <p>
            With Guardarian Pro, clients can check their transaction history, transaction details of the past orders and
            initiate new transactions as well! The log in process consists of simple authentication (email or SMS),
            which should already be familiar to existing clients. Just make sure to use the same email/Phone nr which
            was used to initiate your previous transactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that Guardarian is still an account free service, which does not require a log in step for
            placing orders. You can still perform transactions without using Guardarian Pro.
