            Trading and investing in virtual currencies involve substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for all
            types of investors. Please make sure you are investing mindfully after understanding the nature, complexity
            and risks inherent in the trading of virtual currency. You should not purchase virtual currency unless you
            understand the extent of your exposure to potential loss. Please make sure you are not risking funds you
            cannot afford to lose. In no event shall Guardarian be liable to any loss or damage of any kind incurred as

            Security risks could occur both from Guardarian and user side.To ensure control over security risks,
            Guardarian has implemented the best security practices aiming to decrease security risk level to the lowest
            possible level and is updating and monitoring them constantly. However, no one can be 100% safe from
            security risks, therefore, it is very important that not only Guardarian but also the user acts with due
            care when it comes to preventing security incidents from taking place.

          <p>
            To mitigate security risks, it is important to understand how they may occur and what may have impact for
            their occurrence. Examples of the security risks are leak or theft, or loss of User’s identity information
            or Identifier, other fraudulent act enabling third parties to make abusive, fraudulent or unauthorized use
            of User’s Account which in this case is phone number , for instance, placement of payment orders on behalf
            of the User without actual authorization of the User. In addition, technical problems may occur in the
            User’s computer or the internet being used for Services or even in the network of mobile telephone operators
            which can prevent or suspend the use of the Services. All these actions can lead to losses for the User as
            well as be a part of other illegal actions, including money laundering / terrorist financing.
